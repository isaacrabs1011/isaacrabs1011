Notes about the game:

- If you win a round your votes get transferred into score.
- If you lose you don't gain any votes
- If it's a draw then both of them get the points

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- If there's a draw of points, both players get the points.


**Potential Future Modifications:**

- When Saving the database could have to do something when 2 different people have the same name.
- Get audio samples of the songs for the chosen songs.
- High SCORE!!!!
- Loads of validation
- Upper bound of players
- There can accidentally be the same player twice in 1 game.
- Validation to ensure that the playlist link is valid. 
- Do it with albums - not album tracks but actual album ranking.
- Cover Image
- The players who submitted the songs for the prompt should be hidden to avoid bias (to be fair if you've memorised who's got which songs it won't make much of a difference.
- Have a game mode where the loser of a round gets to keep their score. 
- Have AI bots that will play the game if you need an extra person.
