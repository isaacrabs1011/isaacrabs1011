Notes about the game:

- If you win a round your votes get transferred into score.
- If you lose you don't gain any votes
- If it's a draw then both of them get the points

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- If there's a draw of points, both players get the points.


**Potential Future Modifications:**

- Algorithm will automatically detect how many songs should be in a player's roster instead of having to ask the user.
- When Saving the database could have to do something when 2 different people have the same name.
- Get audio samples of the songs for the chosen songs.
- Might want to have loads of different prompts for the game and not all of them being selected.
- High SCORE!!!!
- Loads of validation
- Upper bound of players
- There can accidentally be the same player twice in 1 game.
- Validation to ensure that the playlist link is valid.
- Do it with albums?
